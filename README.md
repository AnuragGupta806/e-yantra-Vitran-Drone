# e-yantra-Vitran-Drone

e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition launched in the month of August every year for undergraduate students in science and engineering colleges, polytechnic. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits.

Hosted by IIT Bombay and sponsored by Ministry of Education of India

## About Theme: Vitarana Drone
Vitaraá¹‡a means distribution in Sanskrit and many extant languages of South Asia.
In this theme, we were able to learn concepts of control systems, path planning, image processing and algorithm development. We were be exposed to tools such as the Robot Operating System, robotics simulator Gazebo, the Python programming language and many of its libraries.

This competition conducted as a series of tasks, and our final problem statement is for the drone to deliver various packages to their destinations, optimizing for time and quantity.

## Task 0
The aim of this task is to get you started with installation of required software components like ROS Melodic and Gazebo.

## Task 1
The aim of this task is to design controllers which will control the eDrone's orientation as well as position in Gazebo environment namely attitude and position controller scripts.

## Task 2
The aim of this task is to pick a parcel and deliver it to its destination by:
- Scanning the QR code and finding out the destination GPS co-ordinates.
- Pick/Drop the parcel box.
- Avoiding dynamic obstacles and planing the path.

## Task 4
The main aim of this task is to complete a set of deliveries form warehouse location to their destinations using everything we learned till now.

## Task 5
The main aim of this task is to complete a set of deliveries and returns warehouse location to their destinations or vice versa in the most efficient order.

## Task 6
This is the final task which is the complete theme implementation. The aim of this task is to complete a set of deliveries and returns from warehouse location to their destinations or vice versa in the most efficient order to maximize the earnings produced from each delivery or return.

This task had two sub task using:
- Original Configuration
- Bonus Configuration

This task requires us to submit a one-shot demonstration video of our implementation for a given Original Configuration. We can also opt to try Bonus Configuration only after submitting Original Configuration(which we did).
